# Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) Framework

## Overview
The **Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) Framework** is a novel approach that combines **Swarm Intelligence, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Genetic Evolution** to optimize agent performance in dynamic environments. The framework introduces **hyperdimensional computing (HDC), swarm-based optimization, and adaptive task prioritization** to outperform traditional RL techniques such as Q-learning.

## Features
- **Swarm-Based Reinforcement Learning**: Agents adapt dynamically based on performance-driven evolution.
- **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)**: Efficient memory representation for pattern recognition and fast similarity computation.
- **Genetic Algorithm for Evolution**: Agents inherit and evolve traits over generations.
- **Multi-Task Adaptation**: Agents prioritize tasks dynamically based on real-time performance feedback.
- **Optimized RL Updates**: Smooth reinforcement learning updates prevent overfitting and stagnation.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compares ERL against Q-learning to measure long-term stability and efficiency.

## Usage
To run the ERL framework and compare it against Q-learning:
```sh
$ python EvolutionaryReinforcementLearning.py
```
This will:
1. Train an **ERL swarm** over multiple iterations.
2. Train a **Q-learning agent** as a baseline.
3. Plot and compare their performance over time.

## Code Structure
- `erl_framework.py` - Main script for running the ERL experiment.
- `swarm_queen.py` - Manages the evolution of swarm agents.
- `swarm_agent.py` - Individual agents with adaptive reinforcement learning capabilities.
- `hd_memory.py` - Hyperdimensional memory encoding.
- `q_learning.py` - Standard Q-learning implementation for benchmarking.
- `README.md` - This document.

## Benchmarking Results
The framework outperforms standard Q-learning by maintaining more stable and consistent performance over time.
